# BlackJack
 Simple CLI black jack game built in Java.
 
 This CLI black jack game uses the base core rules. The dealer nor player can go over 21.
 If either get to 21 they win and if both get 21 they Push, or it's a "draw". 
 Two cards are dealt to the dealer and player, with the dealer initially having one card facedown.
 The player can then "hit" (have another card dealt to them) or "stand" (their turn ends).
 The dealer then reveals their facedown card, and if their hand is below 17 they keep drawing cards until they are above 17.
 After this whoever has the highest hand total without going over 21 wins.
 
 In order to play this game, you'll need the Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0 and the Java Development Kit 1.8.0.
 To download the game go to the green "Code" button and download the zip file for this repository. 
 Once you extract the files open the command line and navigate to the dist folder. (ex: C:\path\to\BlackJack\dist).
 Once there enter: java -jar BlackJack.jar. This will launch the game.
